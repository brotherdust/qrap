Includes areas of scattered rural dwellings (traditional kraals),  small scale subsistence cultivation, taller (>0.75m) commercial crops (eg maize, vineyards), sparse shack settlements, or urban park areas. Isolated individual buildings or building clusters can be included if too small for other class types.",2.52335,0,3,

Includes all low vegetation covers < 0.75 m, such as natural or man-managed grasslands, low heathland (i.e. karoo, fynbos), and cultivated areas with crops < 0. 75m (incl. fallow fields), irrespective of land-use management practices. Also includes non-vegetated areas such as quarries and open cast mines, dry pans, and tidal mudflats etc.",0.642732,0,3,

A broad sparse - open ? closed canopy community, typically consisting of a single tree canopy layer and a herb (grass) layer. The canopy is composed mainly of self-supporting, single stemmed, woody plants > 5 metres in height. Essentially indigenous species, growing under natural or semi-natural conditions (although it may include some areas of self-seeded exotic species). Excludes planted forests (and woodlots). Canopy cover density classes may be mapped if desired, based on sparse (< 40%), open (40 ? 70 %), and closed (> 70 %).",3.86166,0,2,

Total canopy cover is greater than 10%, with canopy heights between 2 ? 5 metres. Essentially indigenous species, growing under natural or semi-natural conditions (although it may include some areas of self-seeded exotic species, especially along riparian zones). Presence of alien exotic species can be modelled spatially using broad principles of unlikely structural / temporal occurrences within a given vegetation biome or region. Dense bush encroachment would be included in this category.",5.13845,0,2,

Includes both towns, villages, and where applicable, the central nucleus of more open, rural clusters. This class should be used if it is not possible to identify more industrial and transportation land-uses. Low-density smallholdings frequently located on the urban / peri-urban fringe should be mapped as a separate smallholding sub-classes, subdivided by the appropriate (level I) background vegetation type. If visible, individual farm units are to be mapped as isolated urban / built-up units (if no other class is applicable). Specific urban / built-up sub-classes as listed below ? in such cases it could include residential, commercial,",0,0,2,
