# Q-Rap

**Note from repo owner:**
This code was imported from QRAP's SourceForge site, without modification. I added the README.md for informational purposes. The code is here for my own purposes (but maybe someday I'll have the skills to make it so it works with QGIS5/QT5.

Q-Rap is Radio Planning plug-in for QGIS. It was developed for the Radio Technical Services of the South African Police Service by the University of Pretoria (through BE@UP). The SAPS specified that the source code be released to ensure continuous development and maintenance. The core propagation prediction algorithm was made available by CSIR Meraka Institute.

Why the name Q-Rap? It is to give recognition to its predecessor and enablers: RAP and GISRAP was RAdio Planning/Propagation software developed at Mikomtek, CSIR (now the Meraka Institute), and the enabling QGIS. Without the Open Sourced QGIS, this tool would not have been as user friendly, in fact it simply might not have been at all. We also use Qt extensively.

Q-Rap can be used by radio amateurs, Wi-Fi mesh designers, cellular operators, consultants, radio regulators students and lecturers of Mobile Communication courses and researchers in propagation prediction and cellular design.

While the software is free for use by any-one, we particularly hope that it will serve as an enabler for radio amateurs, students and researchers. As for those who intent making (saving) money using Q-Rap, we kindly request you say thank you.
